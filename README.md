# FetchChallenge

Receipt Processor Challenge

Build a webservice that fulfils the documented API. The API is described below. A formal definition is provided in the api.yml file, but the information in this README is sufficient for completion of this challenge. We will use the described API to test your solution.

Provide any instructions required to run your application.

Data does not need to persist when your application stops. It is sufficient to store information in memory. There are too many different database solutions, we will not be installing a database on our system when testing your application.

## Installation

Install Node.js (I'm using v16.20.0) https://nodejs.org/en/download on your computer. If utilizing macOS you and have homebrew use command `brew install node`.
